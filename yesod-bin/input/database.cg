Yesod uses Persistent for its (you guessed it) persistence layer.
This tool will build in either SQLite or PostgreSQL or MongoDB support for you.
We recommend starting with SQLite: it has no dependencies.

    s      = sqlite
    p      = postgresql
    pf     = postgresql + Fay (experimental)
    mongo  = mongodb
    mysql  = MySQL
    simple = no database, no auth
    mini   = bare bones, the "Hello World" of multi-file Yesod apps
             (Note: not configured to work with yesod devel)
    url    = Let me specify URL containing a site (advanced)

So, what'll it be?
