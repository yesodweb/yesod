-- | The base URL for your static files. As you can see by the default

-- A powerful optimization can be serving static files from a separate
-- domain name. This allows you to use a web server optimized for static
-- files, more easily set expires and cache values, and avoid possibly
-- costly transference of cookies on static files. For more information,

-- | Your application will keep a connection pool and take connections from
-- there as necessary instead of continually creating new connections. This
-- value gives the maximum number of connections to be open at a given time.
-- If your application requests a connection when all connections are in
-- use, that request will fail. Try to choose a number that will work well
-- with the system resources available to you while providing enough
-- connections for your expected load.

-- Also, connections are returned to the pool as quickly as possible by
-- Yesod to avoid resource exhaustion. A connection is only considered in
-- use while within a call to runDB.

-- the templates are immediately reflected in an already running
-- application. When making a production compile, the non-debug version
-- is used for increased performance.
--
-- You can see an example of how to call these functions in Handler/Root.hs
--
-- Note: due to polymorphic Hamlet templates, hamletFileDebug is no longer
-- used; to get the same auto-loading effect, it is recommended that you
-- use the devel server.
