# Simple and free deployment to Heroku.

#   This could mean using a virtual machine. Give your VM as much memory as you can to speed up linking.
#
# Yesod setup:
#
# * Move this file out of the deploy directory and into your root directory
#
#     mv deploy/Procfile ./
#
# * Create an empty Gemfile and Gemfile.lock
#
#    touch Gemfile && touch Gemfile.lock
#
# * TODO: code to read DATABASE_URL environment variable.
# 
#   import System.Environment
#   main = do
#     durl <- getEnv "DATABASE_URL"
#     # parse env variable
#     # pass settings to withConnectionPool instead of directly using loadConnStr
#
# Heroku setup:
# Find the Heroku guide. Roughly:
#
# * sign up for a heroku account and register your ssh key
# * create a new application on the *cedar* stack
#
# * make your Yesod project the git repository for that application
# * create a deploy branch
#
#     git checkout -b deploy
#
# Repeat these steps to deploy:
# * add your web executable binary (referenced below) to the git repository
#
#     git add ./dist/build/~project~/~project~
#
# * push to Heroku
#
#     git push heroku deploy:master


# Heroku configuration that runs your app
web: ./dist/build/~project~/~project~ -p $PORT
