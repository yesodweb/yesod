--
-- This function will generate a single clause that will address all
-- your routing needs. It takes four arguments. The fourth (a list of
-- 'Resource's) is self-explanatory. We\'ll discuss the first
-- three. But first, let\'s cover the terminology.
--
-- Dispatching involves a master type and a sub type. When you dispatch to the
-- top level type, master and sub are the same. Each time to dispatch to
-- another subsite, the sub changes. This requires two changes:
--
-- * Getting the new sub value. This is handled via 'subsiteFunc'.
--
-- * Figure out a way to convert sub routes to the original master route. To
-- address this, we keep a toMaster function, and each time we dispatch to a
-- new subsite, we compose it with the constructor for that subsite.
--
-- Dispatching acts on two different components: the request method and a list
-- of path pieces. If we cannot match the path pieces, we need to return a 404
-- response. If the path pieces match, but the method is not supported, we need
-- to return a 405 response.
--
-- The final result of dispatch is going to be an application type. A simple
-- example would be the WAI Application type. However, our handler functions
-- will need more input: the master/subsite, the toMaster function, and the
-- type-safe route. Therefore, we need to have another type, the handler type,
-- and a function that turns a handler into an application, i.e.
--
-- > runHandler :: handler sub master -> master -> sub -> Route sub -> (Route sub -> Route master) -> app
--
-- This is the first argument to our function. Note that this will almost
-- certainly need to be a method of a typeclass, since it will want to behave
-- differently based on the subsite.
--
-- Note that the 404 response passed in is an application, while the 405
-- response is a handler, since the former can\'t be passed the type-safe
-- route.
--
-- In the case of a subsite, we don\'t directly deal with a handler function.
-- Instead, we redispatch to the subsite, passing on the updated sub value and
-- toMaster function, as well as any remaining, unparsed path pieces. This
-- function looks like:
--
-- > dispatcher :: master -> sub -> (Route sub -> Route master) -> app -> handler sub master -> Text -> [Text] -> app
--
-- Where the parameters mean master, sub, toMaster, 404 response, 405 response,
-- request method and path pieces. This is the second argument of our function.
--
-- Finally, we need a way to decide which of the possible formats
-- should the handler send the data out. Think of each URL holding an
-- abstract object which has multiple representation (JSON, plain HTML
-- etc). Each client might have a preference on which format it wants
-- the abstract object in. For example, a javascript making a request
-- (on behalf of a browser) might prefer a JSON object over a plain
-- HTML file where as a user browsing with javascript disabled would
-- want the page in HTML. The third argument is a function that
-- converts the abstract object to the desired representation
-- depending on the preferences sent by the client.
--
-- The typical values for the first three arguments are,
-- @'yesodRunner'@ for the first, @'yesodDispatch'@ for the second and
-- @fmap 'chooseRep'@.
