# Contributor Code of Conduct

Always be nice.

When communicating online treat people the way you would if
they were standing next to you.

Don't forget to be nice whenever representing the
project to others outside the project.

If you are not nice, apologize.

If someone is not being nice, tell them in a respectful way or tell a project maintainer: we care about fostering a welcoming community.
