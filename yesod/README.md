There are 2 main features of the executable

* yesod init - create a scaffolded site

# Scaffolding

## Test suite

install the shelltest package: cabal install shelltests

Run this from the project root directory. It will make sure each site type builds. It first does an sdist, which ensures we are testing what will be put on hackage.

  test/run.sh

Give it the --debug flag to see all output

## Quicker, repeatable site building

Useful for debugging individual failures.

  test/runscaffold.sh < sqlite-input.txt

## Getting a list of scaffold files for the cabal file

It is necessary after adding a scaffolding file to add it to the list of files in the cabal file.

  find scaffold -type f
