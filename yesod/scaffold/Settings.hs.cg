-- | The base URL for your static files. As you can see by the default
-- value, this can simply be "static" appended to your application root.
-- A powerful optimization can be serving static files from a separate
-- domain name. This allows you to use a web server optimized for static
-- files, more easily set expires and cache values, and avoid possibly
-- costly transference of cookies on static files. For more information,
-- please see:

-- If you change the resource pattern for StaticR in Foundation.hs, you will
