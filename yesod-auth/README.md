## yesod-auth

This package provides a pluggable mechanism for allowing users to authenticate
with your site. It comes with a number of common plugins, such as OpenID,
BrowserID (a.k.a., Mozilla Persona), and email. Other packages are available
from Hackage as well. If you've written such an add-on, please notify me so
that it can be added to this description.

* [yesod-auth-account](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/yesod-auth-account): An account authentication plugin for Yesod
* [yesod-auth-hashdb](http://www.stackage.org/package/yesod-auth-hashdb): The HashDB module previously packaged in yesod-auth, now with stronger, but compatible, security.
* [yesod-auth-bcrypt](https://github.com/ollieh/yesod-auth-bcrypt/): An alternative to the HashDB module.
