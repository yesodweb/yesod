### Bug Reports

Reporting a bug? If relevant, we recommend including:

* Your OS name and version
* The versions of tools you're using (e.g. `stack`, `yesod` `ghc`).
* The versions of dependencies you're using

For your convenience, we recommend pasting this script into bash and uploading the output [as a gist](https://gist.github.com/).

```
command -v sw_vers && sw_vers # OS X only
command -v uname && uname -a # Kernel version
command -v stack && stack --version
command -v stack && stack ghc -- --version
command -v stack && stack ls dependencies
command -v yesod && yesod version
```

* Also, is there anything custom or unusual about your setup? i.e. new or prerelease versions of GHC, stack, etc.

* Finally, if possible, please reproduce the error in a small script, or if necessary create a new Github repo with the smallest possible reproducing case. [Stack's scripting support](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/GUIDE/#script-interpreter) might be useful for creating your reproduction example.

### Support

Please direct support questions to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/yesod+haskell) or the [Yesod Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/yesodweb). If you don't get a response there, or you suspect there may be a bug in Yesod causing your problem, you're welcome to ask here.
